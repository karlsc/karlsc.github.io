        <p>I am originnaly from the North shore of Montréal. I have 
        been living here for more than 3 years now. I used to be an IT 
        guy but decided that it was time for me to do what I always 
        wanted to do as a kid, build websites.</p>

            <li>I always been a computer guy.</li>
